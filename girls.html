          <h4>OCH ROCH Farleighstud Gerda UD RM RAE3</h4>
          <p>
            Dayzee was born on 5<sup>th</sup> May 2014 at “Farleighstud” located
            at Armidale. When we arrived to collect her she took an immediate
            shine to Jack and we could just tell they would be mates for life.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is certainly a farm girl at heart and is happiest when at home
            keeping a close eye on the cattle.
          </p>
