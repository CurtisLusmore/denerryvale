        <h1>Breed Standard</h1>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>
          The general appearance shall be that of a well proportioned dog, the
          smooth outline showing quality, gracefulness and perfect balance,
          combined with sufficient substance to ensure that it is capable of
          enduring long periods of active duty in its intended task as a
          working sheep dog. Any tendency to coarseness or weediness is
          undesirable.
        </p>
        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
          The Border Collie is highly intelligent, with an instinctive tendency
          to work and is readily responsive to training. Its keen, alert and
          eager expression add to its intelligent appearance, whilst its loyal
          and faithful nature demonstrates that it is at all times kindly
          disposed towards stock. Any aspect of structure or temperament
          foreign to a working dog is uncharacteristic.
        </p>
        <h3>Head and Skull</h3>
        <p>
          The skull is broad and flat between the ears, slightly narrowing to
          the eye, with a pronounced stop, cheeks deep but not prominent. The
          muzzle tapering to the nose, is strong and the same length as the
          skull. The lips are tight and clean and the nose is large with open
          nostrils. The nose colour in all dogs will be a solid colour with no
          pink or light pigment, and shall complement the background colour of
          the dog.
        </p>
        <h3>Eyes</h3>
        <p>
          The eyes are set wide apart, oval shaped of moderate size harmonising
          with the colour of the coat but darker colour preferred, except in
          the case of chocolate where a lighter colour is permissible and in
          the case of merles where blue is permissible. The expression is mild
          but keen, alert and intelligent.
        </p>
        <h3>Ear</h3>
        <p>
          Medium size and texture, set well apart. Carried erect or semierect
          and sensitive in use.
        </p>
        <h3>Mouth</h3>
        <p>
          The teeth should be sound, strong and evenly spaced, the lower
          incisors just behind but touching the upper, that is a scissor bite.
        </p>
        <h3>Neck</h3>
        <p>
          The neck is of good length, strong and muscular, slightly arched and
          broadening to the shoulders, without throatiness or coarseness.
        </p>
        <h3>Forequarters</h3>
        <p>
          The shoulders are long, and well angulated to the upper arm, neither
          in nor out at elbow. The forelegs are well boned, straight and
          parallel when viewed from the front. Pasterns show flexibility with a
          slight slope when viewed from the side.
        </p>
        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>
          The body is moderately long with well sprung ribs tapering to a
          fairly deep and moderately broad chest. The loins are broad, deep,
          muscular and only slightly arched, flanks deep and not cut up.
        </p>
        <h3>Hindquarters</h3>
        <p>
          The hindquarters are broad and muscular, in profile sloping
          gracefully to the set on of tail. The thighs are long, broad, deep
          and muscular with well turned stifles and strong hocks, well let
          down, and when viewed from the rear are straight and parallel.
        </p>
        <h3>Feet</h3>
        <p>
          Oval in shape, pads deep, strong and sound, toes moderately arched
          and close together. Nails short and strong.
        </p>
        <h3>Tail</h3>
        <p>
          The tail is moderately long, set on low, well furnished and with an
          upward swirl towards the end, completing the graceful contour and
          balance of the dog. The tail may be raised in excitement, but not
          carried over the back.
        </p>
        <h3>Gait/Movement</h3>
        <p>
          The movement is free, smooth and tireless, with a minimum lift of the
          feet, conveying the impression of the ability to move with great
          stealth. The action, viewed from the front, should be straight
          forward and true, without weakness at shoulders, elbows or pasterns.
          Viewed from behind the quarters thrust with strength and flexibility,
          with hocks not close nor too far apart. When trotting, the dog's feet
          tend to come closer together as speed increases, but when the dog
          comes to rest he should stand four square. Any tendency to stiltiness
          or to cowhocks or bowhocks is a serious fault.
        </p>
        <h3>Coat</h3>
        <p>
          HAIR: Two varieties: Moderately long or Smooth. In both, topcoat
          dense and medium textured, undercoat soft and dense giving good
          weather resistance. In the moderately long-coated variety, abundant
          coat forms mane, breeching and brush. On face, ears, forelegs (except
          for feather), hindlegs from hock to ground, hair should be short and
          smooth.
        </p>
        <h3>Colour</h3>
        <p>
          Variety of colours permissible. White should never predominate.
        </p>
        <h3>Sizes</h3>
        <p>
          Dogs 48-53 cm (approx. 19-21 ins) at withers<br />
          Bitches 46-51 cm (approx. 18-20 ins) at withers
        </p>
        <h3>Faults</h3>
        <p>
          Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault
          and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be
          in exact proportion to its degree and its effect upon the health and
          welfare of the dog.
        </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Male animals should have two apparently normal testicles fully
          descended into the scrotum.
