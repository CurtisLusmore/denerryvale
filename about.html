        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Denerry Vale was established in 2009 and has since been developed
          into a beautiful rural property breeding quality Border Collies and
          Angus Cattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ours lives haven’t quite been the same since the beautiful Jack &
          Dayzee joined us in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we started taking them to training, we were mainly interested in
          knowing the best way we could develop a long and mutual relationship
          that was beneficial to both the dogs and us. We knew that Border
          Collies could be a handful and we wanted to make sure that we could
          offer them the interaction and stimulation that they would need
          during their lives with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being the incredibly smart creatures that they are, I was just blown
          away by how responsive they were to the training and just how much
          they enjoyed the interaction. It wasn’t long before I wanted to have
          a crack at trialling.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our local club only trained in obedience, that is where we
          started. One obedience trial, and I had the bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of years later, after much encouragement from a fellow club
          member who had some additional experience under her belt, we ventured
          into rally obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bug has strengthened and now we combine our love of travelling
          Australia in our caravan with my love of trialling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dayzee is now an Obedience Champion, and both Jack and Dayzee are
          Rally Obedience Champions.
